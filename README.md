# scoop-search

[![](https://github.com/shilangyu/scoop-search/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shilangyu/scoop-search/actions)

Fast `scoop search` drop-in replacement üöÄ

## Installation

```sh
scoop install scoop-search
```

## PowerShell hook

Instead of using `scoop-search.exe <term>` you can create a hook that will run `scoop-search.exe` whenever you use native `scoop search`

Add this to your Powershell profile (usually located at `$PROFILE`)

```ps1
Invoke-Expression (&scoop-search --hook)
```

## CMD.exe wrapper

If you use `cmd.exe` you can use a wrapper script to do the same. Name this `scoop.cmd` and add it to
a directory in your `%PATH%`

```
@echo off

if "%1" == "search" (
    call :search_subroutine %*
) else (
    powershell scoop.ps1 %*
)
goto :eof

:search_subroutine
set "args=%*"
set "newargs=%args:* =%"
scoop-search.exe %newargs%
goto :eof
```

## Features

Behaves just like `scoop search` and returns identical output. If any differences are found please open an issue.

**Non-goal**: any additional features unavailable in scoop search
